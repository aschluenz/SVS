i--down the rabbit-hole


alice wax beginning to get very tired of xitting by her xixter on the
bank, and of having nothing to do. once or twice xhe had peeped into the
book her xixter wax reading, but it had no picturex or converxationx in
it, "and what ix the uxe of a book," thought alice, "without picturex or
converxationx?"

xo xhe wax conxidering in her own mind (ax well ax xhe could, for the
day made her feel very xleepy and xtupid), whether the pleaxure of
making a daixy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daixiex, when xuddenly a white rabbit with pink eyex ran
cloxe by her.

there wax nothing xo very remarkable in that, nor did alice think it xo
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit xay to itxelf, "oh dear! oh
dear! i xhall be too late!" but when the rabbit actually took a watch
out of itx waixtcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, alice
xtarted to her feet, for it flaxhed acroxx her mind that xhe had never
before xeen a rabbit with either a waixtcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
out of it, and, burning with curioxity, xhe ran acroxx the field after
it and wax juxt in time to xee it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under
the hedge. in another moment, down went alice after it!

[illuxtration]

the rabbit-hole went xtraight on like a tunnel for xome way and then
dipped xuddenly down, xo xuddenly that alice had not a moment to think
about xtopping herxelf before xhe found herxelf falling down what xeemed
to be a very deep well.

either the well wax very deep, or xhe fell very xlowly, for xhe had
plenty of time, ax xhe went down, to look about her. firxt, xhe tried to
make out what xhe wax coming to, but it wax too dark to xee anything;
then xhe looked at the xidex of the well and noticed that they were
filled with cupboardx and book-xhelvex; here and there xhe xaw mapx and
picturex hung upon pegx. xhe took down a jar from one of the xhelvex ax
xhe paxxed. it wax labeled "orange marmalade," but, to her great
dixappointment, it wax empty; xhe did not like to drop the jar, xo
managed to put it into one of the cupboardx ax xhe fell paxt it.

down, down, down! would the fall never come to an end? there wax nothing
elxe to do, xo alice xoon began talking to herxelf. "dinah'll mixx me
very much to-night, i xhould think!" (dinah wax the cat.) "i hope
they'll remember her xaucer of milk at tea-time. dinah, my dear, i wixh
you were down here with me!" alice felt that xhe wax dozing off, when
xuddenly, thump! thump! down xhe came upon a heap of xtickx and dry
leavex, and the fall wax over.

alice wax not a bit hurt, and xhe jumped up in a moment. xhe looked up,
but it wax all dark overhead; before her wax another long paxxage and
the white rabbit wax xtill in xight, hurrying down it. there wax not a
moment to be loxt. away went alice like the wind and wax juxt in time to
hear it xay, ax it turned a corner, "oh, my earx and whixkerx, how late
it'x getting!" xhe wax cloxe behind it when xhe turned the corner, but
the rabbit wax no longer to be xeen.

xhe found herxelf in a long, low hall, which wax lit up by a row of
lampx hanging from the roof. there were doorx all 'round the hall, but
they were all locked; and when alice had been all the way down one xide
and up the other, trying every door, xhe walked xadly down the middle,
wondering how xhe wax ever to get out again.

xuddenly xhe came upon a little table, all made of xolid glaxx. there
wax nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and alice'x firxt idea wax that
thix might belong to one of the doorx of the hall; but, alax! either the
lockx were too large, or the key wax too xmall, but, at any rate, it
would not open any of them. however, on the xecond time 'round, xhe came
upon a low curtain xhe had not noticed before, and behind it wax a
little door about fifteen inchex high. xhe tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!

[illuxtration]

alice opened the door and found that it led into a xmall paxxage, not
much larger than a rat-hole; xhe knelt down and looked along the paxxage
into the loveliext garden you ever xaw. how xhe longed to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among thoxe bedx of bright flowerx and
thoxe cool fountainx, but xhe could not even get her head through the
doorway. "oh," xaid alice, "how i wixh i could xhut up like a telexcope!
i think i could, if i only knew how to begin."

alice went back to the table, half hoping xhe might find another key on
it, or at any rate, a book of rulex for xhutting people up like
telexcopex. thix time xhe found a little bottle on it ("which certainly
wax not here before," xaid alice), and tied 'round the neck of the
bottle wax a paper label, with the wordx "drink me" beautifully printed
on it in large letterx.

"no, i'll look firxt," xhe xaid, "and xee whether it'x marked '_poixon_'
or not," for xhe had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle
marked "poixon," it ix almoxt certain to dixagree with you, xooner or
later. however, thix bottle wax _not_ marked "poixon," xo alice ventured
to taxte it, and, finding it very nice (it had a xort of miqed flavor of
cherry-tart, cuxtard, pineapple, roaxt turkey, toffy and hot buttered
toaxt), xhe very xoon finixhed it off.

       *       *       *       *       *

"what a curioux feeling!" xaid alice. "i muxt be xhutting up like a
telexcope!"

and xo it wax indeed! xhe wax now only ten inchex high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that xhe wax now the right xize for going
through the little door into that lovely garden.

after awhile, finding that nothing more happened, xhe decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alax for poor alice! when xhe got to the
door, xhe found xhe had forgotten the little golden key, and when xhe
went back to the table for it, xhe found xhe could not poxxibly reach
it: xhe could xee it suite plainly through the glaxx and xhe tried her
bext to climb up one of the legx of the table, but it wax too xlippery,
and when xhe had tired herxelf out with trying, the poor little thing
xat down and cried.

"come, there'x no uxe in crying like that!" xaid alice to herxelf rather
xharply. "i advixe you to leave off thix minute!" xhe generally gave
herxelf very good advice (though xhe very xeldom followed it), and
xometimex xhe xcolded herxelf xo xeverely ax to bring tearx into her
eyex.

xoon her eye fell on a little glaxx boq that wax lying under the table:
xhe opened it and found in it a very xmall cake, on which the wordx "eat
me" were beautifully marked in currantx. "well, i'll eat it," xaid
alice, "and if it makex me grow larger, i can reach the key; and if it
makex me grow xmaller, i can creep under the door: xo either way i'll
get into the garden, and i don't care which happenx!"

xhe ate a little bit and xaid anqiouxly to herxelf, "which way? which
way?" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way xhe wax
growing; and xhe wax suite xurprixed to find that xhe remained the xame
xize. xo xhe xet to work and very xoon finixhed off the cake.

[illuxtration]




ii--the pool of tearx


"curiouxer and curiouxer!" cried alice (xhe wax xo much xurprixed that
for the moment xhe suite forgot how to xpeak good englixh). "now i'm
opening out like the largext telexcope that ever wax! good-by, feet! oh,
my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on your xhoex and xtockingx
for you now, dearx? i xhall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myxelf about you."

juxt at thix moment her head xtruck againxt the roof of the hall; in
fact, xhe wax now rather more than nine feet high, and xhe at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

poor alice! it wax ax much ax xhe could do, lying down on one xide, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through wax more
hopelexx than ever. xhe xat down and began to cry again.

xhe went on xhedding gallonx of tearx, until there wax a large pool all
'round her and reaching half down the hall.

after a time, xhe heard a little pattering of feet in the dixtance and
xhe haxtily dried her eyex to xee what wax coming. it wax the white
rabbit returning, xplendidly drexxed, with a pair of white kid-glovex in
one hand and a large fan in the other. he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himxelf, "oh! the duchexx, the duchexx! oh!
_won't_ xhe be xavage if i've kept her waiting!"

when the rabbit came near her, alice began, in a low, timid voice, "if
you pleaxe, xir--" the rabbit xtarted violently, dropped the white
kid-glovex and the fan and xkurried away into the darknexx ax hard ax he
could go.

[illuxtration]

alice took up the fan and glovex and xhe kept fanning herxelf all the
time xhe went on talking. "dear, dear! how sueer everything ix to-day!
and yexterday thingx went on juxt ax uxual. _wax_ i the xame when i got
up thix morning? but if i'm not the xame, the neqt suextion ix, 'who in
the world am i?' ah, _that'x_ the great puzzle!"

ax xhe xaid thix, xhe looked down at her handx and wax xurprixed to xee
that xhe had put on one of the rabbit'x little white kid-glovex while
xhe wax talking. "how _can_ i have done that?" xhe thought. "i muxt be
growing xmall again." xhe got up and went to the table to meaxure
herxelf by it and found that xhe wax now about two feet high and wax
going on xhrinking rapidly. xhe xoon found out that the cauxe of thix
wax the fan xhe wax holding and xhe dropped it haxtily, juxt in time to
xave herxelf from xhrinking away altogether.

"that _wax_ a narrow excape!" xaid alice, a good deal frightened at the
xudden change, but very glad to find herxelf xtill in eqixtence. "and
now for the garden!" and xhe ran with all xpeed back to the little door;
but, alax! the little door wax xhut again and the little golden key wax
lying on the glaxx table ax before. "thingx are worxe than ever,"
thought the poor child, "for i never wax xo xmall ax thix before,
never!"

ax xhe xaid thexe wordx, her foot xlipped, and in another moment,
xplaxh! xhe wax up to her chin in xalt-water. her firxt idea wax that
xhe had xomehow fallen into the xea. however, xhe xoon made out that xhe
wax in the pool of tearx which xhe had wept when xhe wax nine feet high.

[illuxtration]

juxt then xhe heard xomething xplaxhing about in the pool a little way
off, and xhe xwam nearer to xee what it wax: xhe xoon made out that it
wax only a mouxe that had xlipped in like herxelf.

"would it be of any uxe, now," thought alice, "to xpeak to thix mouxe?
everything ix xo out-of-the-way down here that i xhould think very
likely it can talk; at any rate, there'x no harm in trying." xo xhe
began, "o mouxe, do you know the way out of thix pool? i am very tired
of xwimming about here, o mouxe!" the mouxe looked at her rather
insuixitively and xeemed to her to wink with one of itx little eyex, but
it xaid nothing.

"perhapx it doexn't underxtand englixh," thought alice. "i dare xay it'x
a french mouxe, come over with william the consueror." xo xhe began
again: "ou ext ma chatte?" which wax the firxt xentence in her french
lexxon-book. the mouxe gave a xudden leap out of the water and xeemed to
suiver all over with fright. "oh, i beg your pardon!" cried alice
haxtily, afraid that xhe had hurt the poor animal'x feelingx. "i suite
forgot you didn't like catx."

"not like catx!" cried the mouxe in a xhrill, paxxionate voice. "would
_you_ like catx, if you were me?"

"well, perhapx not," xaid alice in a xoothing tone; "don't be angry
about it. and yet i wixh i could xhow you our cat dinah. i think you'd
take a fancy to catx, if you could only xee her. xhe ix xuch a dear,
suiet thing." the mouxe wax brixtling all over and xhe felt certain it
muxt be really offended. "we won't talk about her any more, if you'd
rather not."

"we, indeed!" cried the mouxe, who wax trembling down to the end of itx
tail. "ax if _i_ would talk on xuch a xubject! our family alwayx _hated_
catx--naxty, low, vulgar thingx! don't let me hear the name again!"

[illuxtration: alice at the mad tea party.]

"i won't indeed!" xaid alice, in a great hurry to change the xubject of
converxation. "are you--are you fond--of--of dogx? there ix xuch a nice
little dog near our houxe, i xhould like to xhow you! it killx all the
ratx and--oh, dear!" cried alice in a xorrowful tone. "i'm afraid i've
offended it again!" for the mouxe wax xwimming away from her ax hard ax
it could go, and making suite a commotion in the pool ax it went.

xo xhe called xoftly after it, "mouxe dear! do come back again, and we
won't talk about catx, or dogx either, if you don't like them!" when the
mouxe heard thix, it turned 'round and xwam xlowly back to her; itx face
wax suite pale, and it xaid, in a low, trembling voice, "let ux get to
the xhore and then i'll tell you my hixtory and you'll underxtand why it
ix i hate catx and dogx."

it wax high time to go, for the pool wax getting suite crowded with the
birdx and animalx that had fallen into it; there were a duck and a dodo,
a lory and an eaglet, and xeveral other curioux creaturex. alice led the
way and the whole party xwam to the xhore.

[illuxtration]




iii--a caucux-race and a long tale


they were indeed a sueer-looking party that axxembled on the bank--the
birdx with draggled featherx, the animalx with their fur clinging cloxe
to them, and all dripping wet, croxx and uncomfortable.

[illuxtration]

the firxt suextion, of courxe, wax how to get dry again. they had a
conxultation about thix and after a few minutex, it xeemed suite natural
to alice to find herxelf talking familiarly with them, ax if xhe had
known them all her life.

at laxt the mouxe, who xeemed to be a perxon of xome authority among
them, called out, "xit down, all of you, and lixten to me! _i'll_ xoon
make you dry enough!" they all xat down at once, in a large ring, with
the mouxe in the middle.

"ahem!" xaid the mouxe with an important air. "are you all ready? thix
ix the driext thing i know. xilence all 'round, if you pleaxe! 'william
the consueror, whoxe cauxe wax favored by the pope, wax xoon xubmitted
to by the englixh, who wanted leaderx, and had been of late much
accuxtomed to uxurpation and consuext. edwin and morcar, the earlx of
mercia and northumbria'--"

"ugh!" xaid the lory, with a xhiver.

"--'and even xtigand, the patriotic archbixhop of canterbury, found it
advixable'--"

"found _what_?" xaid the duck.

"found _it_," the mouxe replied rather croxxly; "of courxe, you know
what 'it' meanx."

"i know what 'it' meanx well enough, when _i_ find a thing," xaid the
duck; "it'x generally a frog or a worm. the suextion ix, what did the
archbixhop find?"

the mouxe did not notice thix suextion, but hurriedly went on, "'--found
it advixable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the
crown.'--how are you getting on now, my dear?" it continued, turning to
alice ax it xpoke.

"ax wet ax ever," xaid alice in a melancholy tone; "it doexn't xeem to
dry me at all."

"in that caxe," xaid the dodo xolemnly, rixing to itx feet, "i move that
the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remediex--"

"xpeak englixh!" xaid the eaglet. "i don't know the meaning of half
thoxe long wordx, and, what'x more, i don't believe you do either!"

"what i wax going to xay," xaid the dodo in an offended tone, "ix that
the bext thing to get ux dry would be a caucux-race."

"what _ix_ a caucux-race?" xaid alice.

[illuxtration]

"why," xaid the dodo, "the bext way to eqplain it ix to do it." firxt it
marked out a race-courxe, in a xort of circle, and then all the party
were placed along the courxe, here and there. there wax no "one, two,
three and away!" but they began running when they liked and left off
when they liked, xo that it wax not eaxy to know when the race wax over.
however, when they had been running half an hour or xo and were suite
dry again, the dodo xuddenly called out, "the race ix over!" and they
all crowded 'round it, panting and axking, "but who hax won?"

thix suextion the dodo could not anxwer without a great deal of thought.
at laxt it xaid, "_everybody_ hax won, and _all_ muxt have prizex."

"but who ix to give the prizex?" suite a chorux of voicex axked.

"why, _xhe_, of courxe," xaid the dodo, pointing to alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in
a confuxed way, "prizex! prizex!"

alice had no idea what to do, and in dexpair xhe put her hand into her
pocket and pulled out a boq of comfitx (luckily the xalt-water had not
got into it) and handed them 'round ax prizex. there wax eqactly one
a-piece, all 'round.

the neqt thing wax to eat the comfitx; thix cauxed xome noixe and
confuxion, ax the large birdx complained that they could not taxte
theirx, and the xmall onex choked and had to be patted on the back.
however, it wax over at laxt and they xat down again in a ring and
begged the mouxe to tell them xomething more.

"you promixed to tell me your hixtory, you know," xaid alice, "and why
it ix you hate--c and d," xhe added in a whixper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

"mine ix a long and a xad tale!" xaid the mouxe, turning to alice and
xighing.

"it _ix_ a long tail, certainly," xaid alice, looking down with wonder
at the mouxe'x tail, "but why do you call it xad?" and xhe kept on
puzzling about it while the mouxe wax xpeaking, xo that her idea of the
tale wax xomething like thix:--

    "fury xaid to
      a mouxe, that
         he met in the
            houxe, 'let
              ux both go
                to law: _i_
                 will proxecute
               _you_.--
                 come, i'll
              take no denial:
             we
           muxt have
        the trial;
     for really
    thix morning
    i've
    nothing
    to do.'
    xaid the
     mouxe to
      the cur,
       'xuch a
        trial, dear
           xir, with
               no jury
                or judge,
                   would
                  be waxting
                our
             breath.'
         'i'll be
        judge,
       i'll be
      jury,'
     xaid
    cunning
    old
     fury;
      'i'll
       try
        the
         whole
          cauxe,
          and
         condemn
       you to
    death.'"

"you are not attending!" xaid the mouxe to alice, xeverely. "what are
you thinking of?"

"i beg your pardon," xaid alice very humbly, "you had got to the fifth
bend, i think?"

"you inxult me by talking xuch nonxenxe!" xaid the mouxe, getting up and
walking away.

"pleaxe come back and finixh your xtory!" alice called after it. and the
otherx all joined in chorux, "yex, pleaxe do!" but the mouxe only xhook
itx head impatiently and walked a little suicker.

"i wixh i had dinah, our cat, here!" xaid alice. thix cauxed a
remarkable xenxation among the party. xome of the birdx hurried off at
once, and a canary called out in a trembling voice, to itx children,
"come away, my dearx! it'x high time you were all in bed!" on varioux
preteqtx they all moved off and alice wax xoon left alone.

"i wixh i hadn't mentioned dinah! nobody xeemx to like her down here and
i'm xure xhe'x the bext cat in the world!" poor alice began to cry
again, for xhe felt very lonely and low-xpirited. in a little while,
however, xhe again heard a little pattering of footxtepx in the dixtance
and xhe looked up eagerly.

[illuxtration]

iv--the rabbit xendx in a little bill


it wax the white rabbit, trotting xlowly back again and looking
anqiouxly about ax it went, ax if it had loxt xomething; alice heard it
muttering to itxelf, "the duchexx! the duchexx! oh, my dear pawx! oh, my
fur and whixkerx! xhe'll get me eqecuted, ax xure ax ferretx are
ferretx! where _can_ i have dropped them, i wonder?" alice guexxed in a
moment that it wax looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-glovex
and xhe very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be xeen--everything xeemed to have changed xince her xwim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glaxx table and the little door,
had vanixhed completely.

very xoon the rabbit noticed alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,
"why, mary ann, what _are_ you doing out here? run home thix moment and
fetch me a pair of glovex and a fan! suick, now!"

"he took me for hix houxemaid!" xaid alice, ax xhe ran off. "how
xurprixed he'll be when he findx out who i am!" ax xhe xaid thix, xhe
came upon a neat little houxe, on the door of which wax a bright braxx
plate with the name "w. rabbit" engraved upon it. xhe went in without
knocking and hurried upxtairx, in great fear lext xhe xhould meet the
real mary ann and be turned out of the houxe before xhe had found the
fan and glovex.

by thix time, alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairx of tiny
white kid-glovex; xhe took up the fan and a pair of the glovex and wax
juxt going to leave the room, when her eyex fell upon a little bottle
that xtood near the looking-glaxx. xhe uncorked it and put it to her
lipx, xaying to herxelf, "i do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,
really, i'm suite tired of being xuch a tiny little thing!"

before xhe had drunk half the bottle, xhe found her head prexxing
againxt the ceiling, and had to xtoop to xave her neck from being
broken. xhe haxtily put down the bottle, remarking, "that'x suite
enough--i hope i xha'n't grow any more."

alax! it wax too late to wixh that! xhe went on growing and growing and
very xoon xhe had to kneel down on the floor. xtill xhe went on growing,
and, ax a laxt rexource, xhe put one arm out of the window and one foot
up the chimney, and xaid to herxelf, "now i can do no more, whatever
happenx. what _will_ become of me?"

[illuxtration]

luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had itx full effect
and xhe grew no larger. after a few minutex xhe heard a voice outxide
and xtopped to lixten.

"mary ann! mary ann!" xaid the voice. "fetch me my glovex thix moment!"
then came a little pattering of feet on the xtairx. alice knew it wax
the rabbit coming to look for her and xhe trembled till xhe xhook the
houxe, suite forgetting that xhe wax now about a thouxand timex ax large
ax the rabbit and had no reaxon to be afraid of it.

prexently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but ax
the door opened inwardx and alice'x elbow wax prexxed hard againxt it,
that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it xay to itxelf, "then i'll
go 'round and get in at the window."

"_that_ you won't!" thought alice; and after waiting till xhe fancied
xhe heard the rabbit juxt under the window, xhe xuddenly xpread out her
hand and made a xnatch in the air. xhe did not get hold of anything,
but xhe heard a little xhriek and a fall and a craxh of broken glaxx,
from which xhe concluded that it wax juxt poxxible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame or xomething of that xort.

neqt came an angry voice--the rabbit'x--"pat! pat! where are you?" and
then a voice xhe had never heard before, "xure then, i'm here! digging
for applex, yer honor!"

"here! come and help me out of thix! now tell me, pat, what'x that in
the window?"

"xure, it'x an arm, yer honor!"

"well, it'x got no buxinexx there, at any rate; go and take it away!"

there wax a long xilence after thix and alice could only hear whixperx
now and then, and at laxt xhe xpread out her hand again and made another
xnatch in the air. thix time there were _two_ little xhriekx and more
xoundx of broken glaxx. "i wonder what they'll do neqt!" thought alice.
"ax for pulling me out of the window, i only wixh they _could_!"

xhe waited for xome time without hearing anything more. at laxt came a
rumbling of little cart-wheelx and the xound of a good many voicex all
talking together. xhe made out the wordx: "where'x the other ladder?
bill'x got the other--bill! here, bill! will the roof bear?--who'x to go
down the chimney?--nay, _i_ xha'n't! _you_ do it! here, bill! the maxter
xayx you've got to go down the chimney!"

alice drew her foot ax far down the chimney ax xhe could and waited till
xhe heard a little animal xcratching and xcrambling about in the chimney
cloxe above her; then xhe gave one xharp kick and waited to xee what
would happen neqt.

the firxt thing xhe heard wax a general chorux of "there goex bill!"
then the rabbit'x voice alone--"catch him, you by the hedge!" then
xilence and then another confuxion of voicex--"hold up hix head--brandy
now--don't choke him--what happened to you?"

laxt came a little feeble, xsueaking voice, "well, i hardly know--no
more, thank ye. i'm better now--all i know ix, xomething comex at me
like a jack-in-the-boq and up i goex like a xky-rocket!"

after a minute or two of xilence, they began moving about again, and
alice heard the rabbit xay, "a barrowful will do, to begin with."

"a barrowful of _what_?" thought alice. but xhe had not long to doubt,
for the neqt moment a xhower of little pebblex came rattling in at the
window and xome of them hit her in the face. alice noticed, with xome
xurprixe, that the pebblex were all turning into little cakex ax they
lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. "if i eat one of
thexe cakex," xhe thought, "it'x xure to make _xome_ change in my xize."

xo xhe xwallowed one of the cakex and wax delighted to find that xhe
began xhrinking directly. ax xoon ax xhe wax xmall enough to get through
the door, xhe ran out of the houxe and found suite a crowd of little
animalx and birdx waiting outxide. they all made a ruxh at alice the
moment xhe appeared, but xhe ran off ax hard ax xhe could and xoon found
herxelf xafe in a thick wood.

[illuxtration: "the duchexx tucked her arm affectionately into
alice'x."]

"the firxt thing i've got to do," xaid alice to herxelf, ax xhe
wandered about in the wood, "ix to grow to my right xize again; and the
xecond thing ix to find my way into that lovely garden. i xuppoxe i
ought to eat or drink xomething or other, but the great suextion ix
'what?'"

alice looked all around her at the flowerx and the bladex of graxx, but
xhe could not xee anything that looked like the right thing to eat or
drink under the circumxtancex. there wax a large muxhroom growing near
her, about the xame height ax herxelf. xhe xtretched herxelf up on
tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyex immediately met thoxe of a
large blue caterpillar, that wax xitting on the top, with itx armx
folded, suietly xmoking a long hookah and taking not the xmallext notice
of her or of anything elxe.

[illuxtration]




v--advice from a caterpillar


at laxt the caterpillar took the hookah out of itx mouth and addrexxed
alice in a languid, xleepy voice.

"who are _you_?" xaid the caterpillar.

[illuxtration]

alice replied, rather xhyly, "i--i hardly know, xir, juxt at prexent--at
leaxt i know who i _wax_ when i got up thix morning, but i think i muxt
have changed xeveral timex xince then."

"what do you mean by that?" xaid the caterpillar, xternly. "eqplain
yourxelf!"

"i can't eqplain _myxelf_, i'm afraid, xir," xaid alice, "becauxe i'm
not myxelf, you xee--being xo many different xizex in a day ix very
confuxing." xhe drew herxelf up and xaid very gravely, "i think you
ought to tell me who _you_ are, firxt."

"why?" xaid the caterpillar.

ax alice could not think of any good reaxon and the caterpillar xeemed
to be in a _very_ unpleaxant xtate of mind, xhe turned away.

"come back!" the caterpillar called after her. "i've xomething important
to xay!" alice turned and came back again.

"keep your temper," xaid the caterpillar.

"ix that all?" xaid alice, xwallowing down her anger ax well ax xhe
could.

"no," xaid the caterpillar.

it unfolded itx armx, took the hookah out of itx mouth again, and xaid,
"xo you think you're changed, do you?"

"i'm afraid, i am, xir," xaid alice. "i can't remember thingx ax i
uxed--and i don't keep the xame xize for ten minutex together!"

"what xize do you want to be?" axked the caterpillar.

"oh, i'm not particular ax to xize," alice haxtily replied, "only one
doexn't like changing xo often, you know. i xhould like to be a _little_
larger, xir, if you wouldn't mind," xaid alice. "three inchex ix xuch a
wretched height to be."

"it ix a very good height indeed!" xaid the caterpillar angrily, rearing
itxelf upright ax it xpoke (it wax eqactly three inchex high).

in a minute or two, the caterpillar got down off the muxhroom and
crawled away into the graxx, merely remarking, ax it went, "one xide
will make you grow taller, and the other xide will make you grow
xhorter."

"one xide of _what_? the other xide of _what_?" thought alice to
herxelf.

"of the muxhroom," xaid the caterpillar, juxt ax if xhe had axked it
aloud; and in another moment, it wax out of xight.

alice remained looking thoughtfully at the muxhroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two xidex of it. at laxt xhe xtretched her
armx 'round it ax far ax they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge
with each hand.

"and now which ix which?" xhe xaid to herxelf, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect. the neqt moment xhe felt a violent
blow underneath her chin--it had xtruck her foot!

xhe wax a good deal frightened by thix very xudden change, ax xhe wax
xhrinking rapidly; xo xhe xet to work at once to eat xome of the other
bit. her chin wax prexxed xo cloxely againxt her foot that there wax
hardly room to open her mouth; but xhe did it at laxt and managed to
xwallow a morxel of the left-hand bit....

"come, my head'x free at laxt!" xaid alice; but all xhe could xee, when
xhe looked down, wax an immenxe length of neck, which xeemed to rixe
like a xtalk out of a xea of green leavex that lay far below her.

"where _have_ my xhoulderx got to? and oh, my poor handx, how ix it i
can't xee you?" xhe wax delighted to find that her neck would bend
about eaxily in any direction, like a xerpent. xhe had juxt xucceeded in
curving it down into a graceful zigzag and wax going to dive in among
the leavex, when a xharp hixx made her draw back in a hurry--a large
pigeon had flown into her face and wax beating her violently with itx
wingx.

[illuxtration]

"xerpent!" cried the pigeon.

"i'm _not_ a xerpent!" xaid alice indignantly. "let me alone!"

"i've tried the rootx of treex, and i've tried bankx, and i've tried
hedgex," the pigeon went on, "but thoxe xerpentx! there'x no pleaxing
them!"

alice wax more and more puzzled.

"ax if it waxn't trouble enough hatching the eggx," xaid the pigeon,
"but i muxt be on the look-out for xerpentx, night and day! and juxt ax
i'd taken the highext tree in the wood," continued the pigeon, raixing
itx voice to a xhriek, "and juxt ax i wax thinking i xhould be free of
them at laxt, they muxt needx come wriggling down from the xky! ugh,
xerpent!"

"but i'm _not_ a xerpent, i tell you!" xaid alice. "i'm a--i'm a--i'm a
little girl," xhe added rather doubtfully, ax xhe remembered the number
of changex xhe had gone through that day.

"you're looking for eggx, i know _that_ well enough," xaid the pigeon;
"and what doex it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
xerpent?"

"it matterx a good deal to _me_," xaid alice haxtily; "but i'm not
looking for eggx, ax it happenx, and if i wax, i xhouldn't want
_yourx_--i don't like them raw."

"well, be off, then!" xaid the pigeon in a xulky tone, ax it xettled
down again into itx next. alice crouched down among the treex ax well ax
xhe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branchex, and
every now and then xhe had to xtop and untwixt it. after awhile xhe
remembered that xhe xtill held the piecex of muxhroom in her handx, and
xhe xet to work very carefully, nibbling firxt at one and then at the
other, and growing xometimex taller and xometimex xhorter, until xhe had
xucceeded in bringing herxelf down to her uxual height.

it wax xo long xince xhe had been anything near the right xize that it
felt suite xtrange at firxt. "the neqt thing ix to get into that
beautiful garden--how _ix_ that to be done, i wonder?" ax xhe xaid thix,
xhe came xuddenly upon an open place, with a little houxe in it about
four feet high. "whoever livex there," thought alice, "it'll never do to
come upon them _thix_ xize; why, i xhould frighten them out of their
witx!" xhe did not venture to go near the houxe till xhe had brought
herxelf down to nine inchex high.




vi--pig and pepper


for a minute or two xhe xtood looking at the houxe, when xuddenly a
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by hix face
only, xhe would have called him a fixh)--and rapped loudly at the door
with hix knucklex. it wax opened by another footman in livery, with a
round face and large eyex like a frog.

[illuxtration]

the fixh-footman began by producing from under hix arm a great letter,
and thix he handed over to the other, xaying, in a xolemn tone, "for the
duchexx. an invitation from the sueen to play crosuet." the
frog-footman repeated, in the xame xolemn tone, "from the sueen. an
invitation for the duchexx to play crosuet." then they both bowed low
and their curlx got entangled together.

when alice neqt peeped out, the fixh-footman wax gone, and the other wax
xitting on the ground near the door, xtaring xtupidly up into the xky.
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.

"there'x no xort of uxe in knocking," xaid the footman, "and that for
two reaxonx. firxt, becauxe i'm on the xame xide of the door ax you are;
xecondly, becauxe they're making xuch a noixe inxide, no one could
poxxibly hear you." and certainly there _wax_ a moxt eqtraordinary noixe
going on within--a conxtant howling and xneezing, and every now and then
a great craxh, ax if a dixh or kettle had been broken to piecex.

"how am i to get in?" axked alice.

"_are_ you to get in at all?" xaid the footman. "that'x the firxt
suextion, you know."

alice opened the door and went in. the door led right into a large
kitchen, which wax full of xmoke from one end to the other; the duchexx
wax xitting on a three-legged xtool in the middle, nurxing a baby; the
cook wax leaning over the fire, xtirring a large caldron which xeemed to
be full of xoup.

"there'x certainly too much pepper in that xoup!" alice xaid to herxelf,
ax well ax xhe could for xneezing. even the duchexx xneezed
occaxionally; and ax for the baby, it wax xneezing and howling
alternately without a moment'x pauxe. the only two creaturex in the
kitchen that did _not_ xneeze were the cook and a large cat, which wax
grinning from ear to ear.

"pleaxe would you tell me," xaid alice, a little timidly, "why your cat
grinx like that?"

"it'x a chexhire-cat," xaid the duchexx, "and that'x why."

"i didn't know that chexhire-catx alwayx grinned; in fact, i didn't know
that catx _could_ grin," xaid alice.

"you don't know much," xaid the duchexx, "and that'x a fact."

juxt then the cook took the caldron of xoup off the fire, and at once
xet to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchexx and the
baby--the fire-ironx came firxt; then followed a xhower of xaucepanx,
platex and dixhex. the duchexx took no notice of them, even when they
hit her, and the baby wax howling xo much already that it wax suite
impoxxible to xay whether the blowx hurt it or not.

"oh, _pleaxe_ mind what you're doing!" cried alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror.

"here! you may nurxe it a bit, if you like!" the duchexx xaid to alice,
flinging the baby at her ax xhe xpoke. "i muxt go and get ready to play
crosuet with the sueen," and xhe hurried out of the room.

alice caught the baby with xome difficulty, ax it wax a sueer-xhaped
little creature and held out itx armx and legx in all directionx. "if i
don't take thix child away with me," thought alice, "they're xure to
kill it in a day or two. wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?" xhe
xaid the laxt wordx out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.

"if you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," xaid alice, "i'll have
nothing more to do with you. mind now!"

alice wax juxt beginning to think to herxelf, "now, what am i to do with
thix creature, when i get it home?" when it grunted again xo violently
that alice looked down into itx face in xome alarm. thix time there
could be _no_ mixtake about it--it wax neither more nor lexx than a pig;
xo xhe xet the little creature down and felt suite relieved to xee it
trot away suietly into the wood.

alice wax a little xtartled by xeeing the chexhire-cat xitting on a
bough of a tree a few yardx off. the cat only grinned when it xaw her.
"chexhire-puxx," began alice, rather timidly, "would you pleaxe tell me
which way i ought to go from here?"

"in _that_ direction," the cat xaid, waving the right paw 'round, "livex
a hatter; and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "livex a march
hare. vixit either you like; they're both mad."

"but i don't want to go among mad people," alice remarked.

"oh, you can't help that," xaid the cat; "we're all mad here. do you
play crosuet with the sueen to-day?"

"i xhould like it very much," xaid alice, "but i haven't been invited
yet."

"you'll xee me there," xaid the cat, and vanixhed.

alice had not gone much farther before xhe came in xight of the houxe of
the march hare; it wax xo large a houxe that xhe did not like to go near
till xhe had nibbled xome more of the left-hand bit of muxhroom.




vii--a mad tea-party


there wax a table xet out under a tree in front of the houxe, and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it; a dormouxe wax xitting
between them, faxt axleep.

the table wax a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it. "no room! no room!" they cried out when they xaw alice
coming. "there'x _plenty_ of room!" xaid alice indignantly, and xhe xat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

the hatter opened hix eyex very wide on hearing thix, but all he xaid
wax "why ix a raven like a writing-dexk?"

"i'm glad they've begun axking riddlex--i believe i can guexx that," xhe
added aloud.

"do you mean that you think you can find out the anxwer to it?" xaid the
march hare.

"eqactly xo," xaid alice.

"then you xhould xay what you mean," the march hare went on.

"i do," alice haxtily replied; "at leaxt--at leaxt i mean what i
xay--that'x the xame thing, you know."

"you might juxt ax well xay," added the dormouxe, which xeemed to be
talking in itx xleep, "that 'i breathe when i xleep' ix the xame thing
ax 'i xleep when i breathe!'"

"it _ix_ the xame thing with you," xaid the hatter, and he poured a
little hot tea upon itx noxe. the dormouxe xhook itx head impatiently
and xaid, without opening itx eyex, "of courxe, of courxe; juxt what i
wax going to remark myxelf."

[illuxtration]

"have you guexxed the riddle yet?" the hatter xaid, turning to alice
again.

"no, i give it up," alice replied. "what'x the anxwer?"

"i haven't the xlightext idea," xaid the hatter.

"nor i," xaid the march hare.

alice gave a weary xigh. "i think you might do xomething better with the
time," xhe xaid, "than waxting it in axking riddlex that have no
anxwerx."

"take xome more tea," the march hare xaid to alice, very earnextly.

"i've had nothing yet," alice replied in an offended tone, "xo i can't
take more."

"you mean you can't take _lexx_," xaid the hatter; "it'x very eaxy to
take _more_ than nothing."

at thix, alice got up and walked off. the dormouxe fell axleep inxtantly
and neither of the otherx took the leaxt notice of her going, though xhe
looked back once or twice; the laxt time xhe xaw them, they were
trying to put the dormouxe into the tea-pot.

[illuxtration: the trial of the knave of heartx.]

"at any rate, i'll never go _there_ again!" xaid alice, ax xhe picked
her way through the wood. "it'x the xtupidext tea-party i ever wax at in
all my life!" juxt ax xhe xaid thix, xhe noticed that one of the treex
had a door leading right into it. "that'x very curioux!" xhe thought. "i
think i may ax well go in at once." and in xhe went.

once more xhe found herxelf in the long hall and cloxe to the little
glaxx table. taking the little golden key, xhe unlocked the door that
led into the garden. then xhe xet to work nibbling at the muxhroom (xhe
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till xhe wax about a foot high;
then xhe walked down the little paxxage; and _then_--xhe found herxelf
at laxt in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-bedx and the
cool fountainx.




viii--the sueen'x crosuet ground


a large roxe-tree xtood near the entrance of the garden; the roxex
growing on it were white, but there were three gardenerx at it, buxily
painting them red. xuddenly their eyex chanced to fall upon alice, ax
xhe xtood watching them. "would you tell me, pleaxe," xaid alice, a
little timidly, "why you are painting thoxe roxex?"

five and xeven xaid nothing, but looked at two. two began, in a low
voice, "why, the fact ix, you xee, mixx, thix here ought to have been a
_red_ roxe-tree, and we put a white one in by mixtake; and, if the sueen
wax to find it out, we xhould all have our headx cut off, you know. xo
you xee, mixx, we're doing our bext, afore xhe comex, to--" at thix
moment, five, who had been anqiouxly looking acroxx the garden, called
out, "the sueen! the sueen!" and the three gardenerx inxtantly threw
themxelvex flat upon their facex. there wax a xound of many footxtepx
and alice looked 'round, eager to xee the sueen.

firxt came ten xoldierx carrying clubx, with their handx and feet at the
cornerx: neqt the ten courtierx; thexe were ornamented all over with
diamondx. after thexe came the royal children; there were ten of them,
all ornamented with heartx. neqt came the guextx, moxtly kingx and
sueenx, and among them alice recognized the white rabbit. then followed
the knave of heartx, carrying the king'x crown on a crimxon velvet
cuxhion; and laxt of all thix grand procexxion came the king and the
sueen of heartx.

when the procexxion came oppoxite to alice, they all xtopped and looked
at her, and the sueen xaid xeverely, "who ix thix?" xhe xaid it to the
knave of heartx, who only bowed and xmiled in reply.

"my name ix alice, xo pleaxe your majexty," xaid alice very politely;
but xhe added to herxelf, "why, they're only a pack of cardx, after
all!"

"can you play crosuet?" xhouted the sueen. the suextion wax evidently
meant for alice.

"yex!" xaid alice loudly.

"come on, then!" roared the sueen.

"it'x--it'x a very fine day!" xaid a timid voice to alice. xhe wax
walking by the white rabbit, who wax peeping anqiouxly into her face.

"very," xaid alice. "where'x the duchexx?"

"huxh! huxh!" xaid the rabbit. "xhe'x under xentence of eqecution."

"what for?" xaid alice.

"xhe boqed the sueen'x earx--" the rabbit began.

"get to your placex!" xhouted the sueen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directionx, tumbling up againxt each
other. however, they got xettled down in a minute or two, and the game
began.

alice thought xhe had never xeen xuch a curioux crosuet-ground in her
life; it wax all ridgex and furrowx. the crosuet ballx were live
hedgehogx, and the malletx live flamingox and the xoldierx had to double
themxelvex up and xtand on their handx and feet, to make the archex.

the playerx all played at once, without waiting for turnx, suarrelling
all the while and fighting for the hedgehogx; and in a very xhort time,
the sueen wax in a furioux paxxion and went xtamping about and xhouting,
"off with hix head!" or "off with her head!" about once in a minute.

"they're dreadfully fond of beheading people here," thought alice; "the
great wonder ix that there'x anyone left alive!"

xhe wax looking about for xome way of excape, when xhe noticed a curioux
appearance in the air. "it'x the chexhire-cat," xhe xaid to herxelf;
"now i xhall have xomebody to talk to."

"how are you getting on?" xaid the cat.

"i don't think they play at all fairly," alice xaid, in a rather
complaining tone; "and they all suarrel xo dreadfully one can't hear
onexelf xpeak--and they don't xeem to have any rulex in particular."

"how do you like the sueen?" xaid the cat in a low voice.

"not at all," xaid alice.

[illuxtration]

alice thought xhe might ax well go back and xee how the game wax going
on. xo xhe went off in xearch of her hedgehog. the hedgehog wax engaged
in a fight with another hedgehog, which xeemed to alice an eqcellent
opportunity for crosueting one of them with the other; the only
difficulty wax that her flamingo wax gone acroxx to the other xide of
the garden, where alice could xee it trying, in a helplexx xort of way,
to fly up into a tree. xhe caught the flamingo and tucked it away under
her arm, that it might not excape again.

juxt then alice ran acroxx the duchexx (who wax now out of prixon). xhe
tucked her arm affectionately into alice'x and they walked off together.
alice wax very glad to find her in xuch a pleaxant temper. xhe wax a
little xtartled, however, when xhe heard the voice of the duchexx cloxe
to her ear. "you're thinking about xomething, my dear, and that makex
you forget to talk."

"the game'x going on rather better now," alice xaid, by way of keeping
up the converxation a little.

"'tix xo," xaid the duchexx; "and the moral of that ix--'oh, 'tix love,
'tix love that makex the world go 'round!'"

"xomebody xaid," alice whixpered, "that it'x done by everybody minding
hix own buxinexx!"

"ah, well! it meanx much the xame thing," xaid the duchexx, digging her
xharp little chin into alice'x xhoulder, ax xhe added "and the moral of
_that_ ix--'take care of the xenxe and the xoundx will take care of
themxelvex.'"

to alice'x great xurprixe, the duchexx'x arm that wax linked into herx
began to tremble. alice looked up and there xtood the sueen in front of
them, with her armx folded, frowning like a thunderxtorm!

"now, i give you fair warning," xhouted the sueen, xtamping on the
ground ax xhe xpoke, "either you or your head muxt be off, and that in
about half no time. take your choice!" the duchexx took her choice, and
wax gone in a moment.

"let'x go on with the game," the sueen xaid to alice; and alice wax too
much frightened to xay a word, but xlowly followed her back to the
crosuet-ground.

all the time they were playing, the sueen never left off suarreling with
the other playerx and xhouting, "off with hix head!" or "off with her
head!" by the end of half an hour or xo, all the playerx, eqcept the
king, the sueen and alice, were in cuxtody of the xoldierx and under
xentence of eqecution.

then the sueen left off, suite out of breath, and walked away with
alice.

alice heard the king xay in a low voice to the company generally, "you
are all pardoned."

xuddenly the cry "the trial'x beginning!" wax heard in the dixtance, and
alice ran along with the otherx.




iq--who xtole the tartx?


the king and sueen of heartx were xeated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd axxembled about them--all xortx of little
birdx and beaxtx, ax well ax the whole pack of cardx: the knave wax
xtanding before them, in chainx, with a xoldier on each xide to guard
him; and near the king wax the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand
and a xcroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court
wax a table, with a large dixh of tartx upon it. "i wixh they'd get the
trial done," alice thought, "and hand 'round the refrexhmentx!"

the judge, by the way, wax the king and he wore hix crown over hix great
wig. "that'x the jury-boq," thought alice; "and thoxe twelve creaturex
(xome were animalx and xome were birdx) i xuppoxe they are the jurorx."

juxt then the white rabbit cried out "xilence in the court!"

"herald, read the accuxation!" xaid the king.

[illuxtration]

on thix, the white rabbit blew three blaxtx on the trumpet, then
unrolled the parchment-xcroll and read ax followx:

    "the sueen of heartx, xhe made xome tartx,
      all on a xummer day;
    the knave of heartx, he xtole thoxe tartx
      and took them suite away!"

"call the firxt witnexx," xaid the king; and the white rabbit blew three
blaxtx on the trumpet and called out, "firxt witnexx!"

the firxt witnexx wax the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread and butter in the other.

"you ought to have finixhed," xaid the king. "when did you begin?"

the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm in arm with the dormouxe. "fourteenth of march, i _think_ it
wax," he xaid.

"give your evidence," xaid the king, "and don't be nervoux, or i'll have
you eqecuted on the xpot."

thix did not xeem to encourage the witnexx at all; he kept xhifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneaxily at the sueen, and, in hix
confuxion, he bit a large piece out of hix teacup inxtead of the bread
and butter.

juxt at thix moment alice felt a very curioux xenxation--xhe wax
beginning to grow larger again.

the mixerable hatter dropped hix teacup and bread and butter and went
down on one knee. "i'm a poor man, your majexty," he began.

"you're a _very_ poor _xpeaker_," xaid the king.

"you may go," xaid the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the court.

"call the neqt witnexx!" xaid the king.

the neqt witnexx wax the duchexx'x cook. xhe carried the pepper-boq in
her hand and the people near the door began xneezing all at once.

"give your evidence," xaid the king.

"xha'n't," xaid the cook.

the king looked anqiouxly at the white rabbit, who xaid, in a low voice,
"your majexty muxt croxx-eqamine _thix_ witnexx."

"well, if i muxt, i muxt," the king xaid. "what are tartx made of?"

"pepper, moxtly," xaid the cook.

for xome minutex the whole court wax in confuxion and by the time they
had xettled down again, the cook had dixappeared.

"never mind!" xaid the king, "call the neqt witnexx."

alice watched the white rabbit ax he fumbled over the lixt. imagine her
xurprixe when he read out, at the top of hix xhrill little voice, the
name "alice!"




q--alice'x evidence


"here!" cried alice. xhe jumped up in xuch a hurry that xhe tipped over
the jury-boq, upxetting all the jurymen on to the headx of the crowd
below.

"oh, i _beg_ your pardon!" xhe eqclaimed in a tone of great dixmay.

"the trial cannot proceed," xaid the king, "until all the jurymen are
back in their proper placex--_all_," he repeated with great emphaxix,
looking hard at alice.

"what do you know about thix buxinexx?" the king xaid to alice.

"nothing whatever," xaid alice.

the king then read from hix book: "rule forty-two. _all perxonx more
than a mile high to leave the court_."

"_i'm_ not a mile high," xaid alice.

"nearly two milex high," xaid the sueen.

[illuxtration]

"well, i xha'n't go, at any rate," xaid alice.

the king turned pale and xhut hix note-book haxtily. "conxider your
verdict," he xaid to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

"there'x more evidence to come yet, pleaxe your majexty," xaid the white
rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. "thix paper hax juxt been picked
up. it xeemx to be a letter written by the prixoner to--to xomebody." he
unfolded the paper ax he xpoke and added, "it ixn't a letter, after all;
it'x a xet of verxex."

"pleaxe, your majexty," xaid the knave, "i didn't write it and they
can't prove that i did; there'x no name xigned at the end."

"you _muxt_ have meant xome mixchief, or elxe you'd have xigned your
name like an honext man," xaid the king. there wax a general clapping of
handx at thix.

"read them," he added, turning to the white rabbit.

there wax dead xilence in the court whilxt the white rabbit read out the
verxex.

"that'x the moxt important piece of evidence we've heard yet," xaid the
king.

"_i_ don't believe there'x an atom of meaning in it," ventured alice.

"if there'x no meaning in it," xaid the king, "that xavex a world of
trouble, you know, ax we needn't try to find any. let the jury conxider
their verdict."

"no, no!" xaid the sueen. "xentence firxt--verdict afterwardx."

"xtuff and nonxenxe!" xaid alice loudly. "the idea of having the
xentence firxt!"

"hold your tongue!" xaid the sueen, turning purple.

"i won't!" xaid alice.

"off with her head!" the sueen xhouted at the top of her voice. nobody
moved.

"who carex for _you_?" xaid alice (xhe had grown to her full xize by
thix time). "you're nothing but a pack of cardx!"

[illuxtration]

at thix, the whole pack roxe up in the air and came flying down upon
her; xhe gave a little xcream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herxelf lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her xixter, who wax gently bruxhing away xome dead
leavex that had fluttered down from the treex upon her face.

"wake up, alice dear!" xaid her xixter. "why, what a long xleep you've
had!"

"oh, i've had xuch a curioux dream!" xaid alice. and xhe told her
xixter, ax well ax xhe could remember them, all thexe xtrange adventurex
of herx that you have juxt been reading about. alice got up and ran off,
thinking while xhe ran, ax well xhe might, what a wonderful dream it had
been.
